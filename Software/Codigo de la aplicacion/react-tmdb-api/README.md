## How to install and run by yourself?
- Clone this repo in your computer and inside the root folder of this project, install the libraries (you can use ```npm i```, ```yarn``` or even ```pnpm i```)
- Once the libraries are installed, you need to create a ```.env``` file in the root folder of the project with a var called ```VITE_TMDB_API_KEY``` and it must have the value of your TMDB API key (if you don't have one, you can check how to get one [here](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started))
- Now, launch the project with ```npm run dev```, ```yarn dev``` or ```pnpm run dev```
- That's it!
